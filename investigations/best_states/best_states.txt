Question2: What States are models of high quality care?
1. Assumptions going into the investigation - Same as question 1, but will re-iterate the assumptions:
    - Hospitals need to have data in all 9 categories of the efective table:
      - Emergency Department, Heart Attack or Chest Pain, Heart Failure, Preventive Care, Surgical Care Improvement Project,
        Pregnancy and Delivery Care, Pneumonia, Stroke Care, Blood Clot Prevention
      - This is because we are looking at overall best quality care, I want to filter out hospitals that are specialized and
        only have certain items of the 9 categories. Taking the average on those, might be skewed. Ex. If they only had two or
        three items from the nine, the average might be artificial since they are specialized in those categories only.
    - Only Data will be used from the effective_care.csv dataframes
      - I did this in order to filter out snowball biasness from recurring patients. The patients might have not taken care of 
        themselves in between the two instances of the hospital visits. Therefore only initial visits will be considered for
        the data analysis
        
2. Process of analysis
    - a) Create average scores and ranks of the average scores for each categories grouped by hospital provider_id (Primary key)
    - b) Smash each individual column category into one table of average value and rank
    - c) filter out NULL values from columns, if one column has a null value then filter out that hospital, as it does not 
         qualify for best overall hospital (smears out heavily skewed data)
    - d) run overall average of rank by grouping by state and averaging the average ranks of the nine categories
    
3. Results
    - rank is better if lower, therefore we want the overall lowest overage for each hospital and output top 10 below:

   - With the logic above, it looks like Maine (ME) is the best overall category for hospitals. I would take this information
     as a data point and not an absolute. Lookin gat the output, it seems like a lot of the outputs are states with lower populations
     and limited population densities. This makes sense, because with less population, you need less hospitals, which brings along with
     with it less variability in quality of care. Less populations means less hospitals whih mean less amount of quality doctors and
     less amount of overall procedures because of lack of population. Less procedures will lead to more rest and higher quality work.
     
     Therefore smaller states are yielding better overall rank (lower is better), and with the above discussion Maine (ME) is the 
     best overall care followed by New Hampshire (NH) and Wisconsin (WI). This is a very vague question with a weak absolute answer.
     Perhaps, normalizing it by the amount of population or even poverty level might smear out the biasness of population 
     associated with this question and response.
