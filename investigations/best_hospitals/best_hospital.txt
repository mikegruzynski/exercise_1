Question1: What Hospitals are models of high quality care?
1. Assumptions going into the investigation:
    - Hospitals need to have data in all 9 categories of the efective table:
      - Emergency Department, Heart Attack or Chest Pain, Heart Failure, Preventive Care, Surgical Care Improvement Project,
        Pregnancy and Delivery Care, Pneumonia, Stroke Care, Blood Clot Prevention
      - This is because we are looking at overall best quality care, I want to filter out hospitals that are specialized and
        only have certain items of the 9 categories. Taking the average on those, might be skewed. Ex. If they only had two or
        three items from the nine, the average might be artificial since they are specialized in those categories only.
    - Only Data will be used from the effective_care.csv dataframes
      - I did this in order to filter out snowball biasness from recurring patients. The patients might have not taken care of 
        themselves in between the two instances of the hospital visits. Therefore only initial visits will be considered for
        the data analysis
        
2. Process of analysis
    - a) Create average scores and ranks of the average scores for each categories grouped by hospital provider_id (Primary key)
    - b) Smash each individual column category into one table of average value and rank
    - c) filter out NULL values from columns, if one column has a null value then filter out that hospital, as it does not 
         qualify for best overall hospital (smears out heavily skewed data)
    - d) run overall average of rank and list top 10
    
3. Results
    - rank is better if lower, therefore we want the overall lowest overage for each hospital and output top 10 below:
KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL-SANTA CLARA  421.67
KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL - PANORAMA CITY      429.33
KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL - SOUTH BAY  463.33
MENORAH MEDICAL CENTER  473.56
AVERA SACRED HEART HOSPITAL     478.56
COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER        493.56
ST CLARES HOSPITAL OF WESTON    496.33
NOVANT HEALTH ROWAN MEDICAL CENTER      533.11
PORTSMOUTH REGIONAL HOSPITAL    540.22
KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL-MORENO VALLEY        545.0
      
      - looking at the data, looks like hospitals in the KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL system is the best, with the Santa Clara one
        at the top of the list. This is part of the Kaiser Permanente Group (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Permanente)
        which is a multi-state integrated managed care consortium, wth revenue in the multi-billion amount. It seems like this
        system is well founded with good staff and technology and is a realistic answer for the question of best overall hospital
