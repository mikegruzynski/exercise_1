Question4: Are Average Scores for hospital quality or variance correlated with patient survey responses?
1. Assumptions
   - Eliminate all null values from any column of 9 responses from effective_care.csv tables or the surveys_responses.csv tables
      - I removed the row. I wanted a clean data frame that in corporated an overall all procedure hospital to limit skew 

2. Process
   - I left joined all data (variance per procedure) or (rank of individual quality hospital) to a table of provider_id
     and then smased survey responses depending on analysis question (hospital quality or procedure variance)
   - then i filtered out all null values, in any column. If any null in column, 
   - then ran corr() function in sql fro two columns either hospital rank vs survey_response rank 
     OR procedure variability vs survey_response rank
     
 3. Results: 
    -hospital rank vs survey_response
    0.15549260093522227
    
    -Correlation for this question was around 0.15, meaning that as rank in survey goes up, the hospital rank goes 
    up with correlation of 0.15. This is a broad answer because we are looking at every variable in both tables averaged
    out, so even if the hospital is overall high response for survey, the procedure variability quality might make it renormailize
    to non existant trend, which we see. This makes sense, because there are a lot of things happening at hospitals and
    surveys are biased repsonses, so looking at a quality vs survey response has heavy bias in it. I would expect it to be around zero,
    because variability is high in some procedure, which can then lead to huge differences in rank in individual columns 
    which bring own the overall rank score average. 
    
    -procedure variability vs survey_response rank
    0.2628239040317933

    - Correlation is slightly higher for variability, which makes more sense. More variability average in a hospital, the higher
    the rank (which is not a good thing, remember low rank is good). So the higher the variability (meaning more range in
    good and bad scores) the higher the rank for survey responses. But agin, like the above response, there is too much to consider
    in these correlations. One bad variation score could ruin the average. 
    
    These data points show low correlation for both instances. This makes sense because there is just too much going on in hospitals.
    Especially because I filtered to only hospitals that offer all procedure (or at least been scored in all procedures),
    there is just too many inputs. Might need to consider poverty or population information, like question 2 conclusion,
    in order to get a better picture.
