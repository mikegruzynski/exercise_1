Question3: What Procedure have the greatest variability between hospitals?
1. Assumptions going into the investigation - Same as question 1, but will re-iterate the assumptions. I used the same assumption
   because I wanted to stay withing the enviornment of overall best hospital since the question had "between hospitals in it":
    - Hospitals need to have data in all 9 categories of the efective table:
      - Emergency Department, Heart Attack or Chest Pain, Heart Failure, Preventive Care, Surgical Care Improvement Project,
        Pregnancy and Delivery Care, Pneumonia, Stroke Care, Blood Clot Prevention
      - This is because we are looking at overall best quality care, I want to filter out hospitals that are specialized and
        only have certain items of the 9 categories. Taking the average on those, might be skewed. Ex. If they only had two or
        three items from the nine, the average might be artificial since they are specialized in those categories only.
    - Only Data will be used from the effective_care.csv dataframes
      - I did this in order to filter out snowball biasness from recurring patients. The patients might have not taken care of 
        themselves in between the two instances of the hospital visits. Therefore only initial visits will be considered for
        the data analysis
