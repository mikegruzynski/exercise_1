Question3: What Procedure have the greatest variability between hospitals?
1. Assumptions going into the investigation - Same as question 1, but will re-iterate the assumptions. I used the same assumption
   because I wanted to stay withing the enviornment of overall best hospital since the question had "between hospitals in it":
    - Hospitals need to have data in all 9 categories of the efective table:
      - Emergency Department, Heart Attack or Chest Pain, Heart Failure, Preventive Care, Surgical Care Improvement Project,
        Pregnancy and Delivery Care, Pneumonia, Stroke Care, Blood Clot Prevention
      - This is because we are looking at overall best quality care, I want to filter out hospitals that are specialized and
        only have certain items of the 9 categories. Taking the average on those, might be skewed. Ex. If they only had two or
        three items from the nine, the average might be artificial since they are specialized in those categories only.
    - Only Data will be used from the effective_care.csv dataframes
      - I did this in order to filter out snowball biasness from recurring patients. The patients might have not taken care of 
        themselves in between the two instances of the hospital visits. Therefore only initial visits will be considered for
        the data analysis

2. Process of analysis
    - a) Create average scores and ranks of the average scores for each categories grouped by hospital provider_id (Primary key)
    - b) Smash each individual column category into one table of average value and rank
    - c) wrote my own variance function : Cariance =  E[x^2] - E[x]^2 and each column is associated with each procedure
        
3. Results
- Column 1: Emergency Department
- Column 2: Heart Attack or Chest Pain
- Column 3: Heart Failure
- Column 4: Preventive Care
- Column 5: Surgical Care Improvement Project
- Column 6: Pregnancy and Delivery Care
- Column 7: Pnuemonia
- Column 8: Stroke Care
- Column 9: Blood Clot
1966.83 563.88  39.63   179.82  6.28    40.32   35.57   13.51   200.79

   - looking at the above information, it looks like the column 1 has the highest variability by far. Column 1 is associated with
     Emergency Department. This variable makes sense for variability of score, do to the fact that anything can come through the 
     ER and the doctors might not be specialized enough to solve the problem perfectly, but they need to do it regardless. Also
     factor in the intensity and the amount of unscheduled work involved and it makes sense that column 1 (Emergency Department)
     is the procedure with the highest variability.
