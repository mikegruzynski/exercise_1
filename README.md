exercise 1 for w205

Notes - Transforming code takes a long time to run, I aplogize but these are my first sql codes ever.

Here is the code and write up for exercize 1 for w205 - Summer 2017.

All Code has comments for what it is and why it was done. All write ups are .txt file inside of the /investigation/<q#>/ folders
with the results and comments. Most of the transforming logic is inside of the comments in the transormation folder sql file with
vaguer discussion inside the write up analysis text files.
